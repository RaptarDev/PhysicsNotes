#### Progressive Waves
**Progressive Waves** are waves that transfer energy from one place to another without the transfer of any material.

### What is a Standing wave?
A **Standing Wave** is the superposition of two progressive waves with the same amplitude and frequency, traveling the same speed but **opposite directions.**   It is an oscillating wave fixed in space. 

### Formation of a Standing wave
Standing waves are most commonly formed when a wave is sent and is reflected back at some fixed point or mirror. Where it is then reflected back and inverted.![[Pasted image 20250624234722.png]]
The incident and the reflected wave then interfere with each other and the resultant wave is a standing wave. 

Every point of the wave does not move left or right, only up and down, therefor no energy is transferred by a standing wave.

### Features of Standing Waves
There is no net transfer of energy from one point to another. Energy is "trapped" in the nodes of the wave (non-moving points). The points that constantly have 0 amplitude we called **Nodes** labeled with a **N**, and then the points that alternate from maxium to minimum displacement are called **Anti-Nodes** labled **AN**
#### Nodes
- Points constantly have 0 amplitude 
- Points with 0 displacement 
- There will always be a node at a fixed boundary
#### Anti-Nodes
- Alternate from maximum positive displacement to minimum negative displacement
- Points of maximum amplitude 
- There will always be a antinode at a open end.

The distance between two nodes or anti-nodes is equal to half a wavelength ($\frac{\lambda}{2}$)

### Demonstrating Standing Waves![[Pasted image 20250625081030.png]]
There will be more sound at the anti-nodes due to them having an higher amplitude, and node 

# Resonance
### Free oscillations 
A **free oscillation** is the oscillation of a system with its own **natural frequency** and under no external influence, other than the impulse that initiated motion. Eg. When we let a pendulum swing it does it as a free oscillation 
#### Natural Frequency 
The frequency a system wants to oscillate at if no external forces are applied Eg. a pendulm
### Forced Oscillation 
A forced oscillation is the oscillation of a system with the frequency of some external vibrator. 
#### Driving frequency 
The frequency that you force a system to oscillate at eg. A swing

### What is Resonance 
When you drive a system at a random frequency, the amplitude of the oscillation is relatively small. However, if the driving frequency is close to the natural frequency, there is an increase in the amplitude of oscillations

**Resonance** is when a system is driven at its natural frequency or driving frequency is equal to the natural frequency. Resonance is a large increase of the amplitude of the oscillations when a system is driven at its natural frequency. ![[Pasted image 20250625105445.png]]

The energy transfer is usually inefficient when driving a system, but it becomes very effect at resonance.
#### Resonance in the real world
When a singer hits a not of the same frequency as the natural frequency of glass, the glass will vibrate and eventually shatter
If you shake a rope at a particular frequency you can create a standing wave

## Harmonic Frequency
Standing wave patterns are only produced when the oscillator, and therefore the string, vibrate at the **Harmonic Frequency (or just harmonic)**. Only at these specific frequencies we call harmonics do we get the production of a standing wave pattern we can observe. The first of these harmonics are called the **fundamental frequency** 
### Harmonic Wave Patterns
Depending on which harmonic frequency the medium is vibrating at we get different patterns. At these harmonic frequency only an exact multiple of half wavelengths on the string, so there is a node at each end. The length of a standing wave can be given as $$L=\frac{n\lambda}{2}$$

For every successive harmonic the Node and Anti node count increases by 1, there a $n+1$ nodes and $n$ anti-nodes
