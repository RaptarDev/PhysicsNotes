#### Progressive Waves
**Progressive Waves** are waves that transfer energy from one place to another without the transfer of any material.

### What is a Standing wave?
A **Standing Wave** is the [[Wave Phenomena#Superposition|superposition]] of two progressive waves with the same amplitude and frequency, traveling the same speed but **opposite directions.**   It is an oscillating wave fixed in space. 

### Formation of a Standing wave
Standing waves are most commonly formed when a wave is sent and is reflected back at some fixed point or mirror. Where it is then reflected back and inverted.![[Pasted image 20250624234722.png]]
The incident and the reflected wave then interfere with each other and the resultant wave is a standing wave. 

Every point of the wave does not move left or right, only up and down, therefor no energy is transferred by a standing wave.

### Features of Standing Waves
There is no net transfer of energy from one point to another. Energy is "trapped" in the nodes of the wave (non-moving points). The points that constantly have 0 amplitude we called **Nodes** labeled with a **N**, and then the points that alternate from maxium to minimum displacement are called **Anti-Nodes** labled **AN**
#### Nodes
- Points constantly have 0 amplitude 
- Points with 0 displacement 
- There will always be a node at a fixed boundary
#### Anti-Nodes
- Alternate from maximum positive displacement to minimum negative displacement
- Points of maximum amplitude 
- There will always be a antinode at a open end.

The distance between two nodes or anti-nodes is equal to half a wavelength ($\frac{\lambda}{2}$)

There will be more sound at the anti-nodes due to them having an higher amplitude, and node
