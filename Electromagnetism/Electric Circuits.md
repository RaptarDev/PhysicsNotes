An **Electric Circuit** is an interconnection of electrical components
**Circuits** are designed to control the flow of charge carries, the '[[current]]' in the device. The current provides energy to the device, allowing the circuit elements to preform a function.
An 
Circuits that maintain constant potential difference are know as direct current circuits or [[DC Circuits]]
### Loop
A **Loop** is any closed conducting path through a circuit.

### Power Source
A **Power Source** is any device that provides electric potential energy to an electric circuit
