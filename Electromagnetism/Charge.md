**Charge** is a fundamental dimension, or property of matter (similar to how matter has mass or volume).
Charge has a positive and negative value, where opposite charge attract, while identical charges repel. This is due to [[Electric Fields]]

$$q=ne$$
$where, \space q=total \space charge \space (C)$
$n=number \space of \space electrons$
$e = charge \space of \space an \space electron \space (10 \times 10^{-19}C)$
