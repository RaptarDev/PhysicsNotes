A neutral object must lose or gain electrons to gain [[charge]].
There are 3 seperate ways to charge an object

## Friction
Charging from physical contact, different objects have different tendencies to attract electrons. When two neutral objects are rubbed against each other, electrons from the lower affinity are removed and given given to the object with higher affinity. One object loses electrons and one gains them hence a change in charge.
## Contact

## Induction
