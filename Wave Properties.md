### Keywords
**Medium:** A medium is a collection of particles that vibrate to allow a wave to move.
**Propagation**: When a wave moves through a medium, we say that the wave is propagating through that medium
## What is a Wave?
A wave is a **vibration** or **oscillation** of a quantity that transfers **energy** from one point to another, **without** the transfer of **matter**.
There are two main types of waves, **Mechanical** and **Electromagnetic** waves.
### Mechanical Waves
**Mechanical Waves** are vibrations or oscillations that move energy from one point to another.
These waves require a medium to propagate through.
#### Type of Mechanical Waves
Mechanical Waves come in two types **Transverse** and **Longitudinal**.
##### Transverse Waves
The particles in transverse waves vibrate **perpendicular** to the direction that the wave propagates.
##### Longitudinal Waves
The particles in longitudinal waves vibrate parallel to the direction that the wave propagates.

### Electromagnetic Waves
**Electromagnetic waves** don't require a medium to propagate through, they instead move by oscillating electric and magnetic fields

## Features of a Wave
### Displacement
The **Displacement** is how far apart a point is from the resting point, equilibrium position of the wave, the centre.

### Amplitude
The **Amplitude** is the absolute maximum displacement of a wave.

### Wavelength
The **Wavelength (λ)** is the distance required for one wave cycle to complete, the distance between the crests or troughs
![[AmplitudeGraph.png]]
### Period
The **Period** is the time take to complete one wave cycle

### Phase Differences
The **Phase Difference** is the measure of the difference between the two phases (φ) of a wave

### Frequency
The **Frequency** is the measure of how many cycles of a wave is complete for a set unit of time, usually 1 second, measured in Hertz ($Hz$)
$$f=\frac{1}{T}$$
$$\text{Where }T \text{ is the period and } f \text{ is the frequency}$$
### Wave Speed
The **Wave Speed** is the speed that a particular point on a wave moves in the direction of propagation
$$v=\frac{λ}{T}$$
$$ \text{Where }T \text{ is the period and } λ \text{ is the wavelength}$$
