### Free oscillations 
A **free oscillation** is the oscillation of a system with its own **natural frequency** and under no external influence, other than the impulse that initiated motion. Eg. When we let a pendulum swing it does it as a free oscillation 
#### Natural Frequency 
The frequency a system wants to oscillate at if no external forces are applied Eg. a pendulm
### Forced Oscillation 
A forced oscillation is the oscillation of a system with the frequency of some external vibrator. 
#### Driving frequency 
The frequency that you force a system to oscillate at eg. A swing

### What is Resonance 
When you drive a system at a random frequency, the amplitude of the oscillation is relatively small. However, if the driving frequency is close to the natural frequency, there is an increase in the amplitude of oscillations

**Resonance** is when a system is driven at its natural frequency or driving frequency is equal to the natural frequency. Resonance is a large increase of the amplitude of the oscillations when a system is driven at its natural frequency. ![[Pasted image 20250625105445.png]]

The energy transfer is usually inefficient when driving a system, but it becomes very effect at resonance.
#### Resonance in the real world
When a singer hits a not of the same frequency as the natural frequency of glass, the glass will vibrate and eventually shatter
If you shake a rope at a particular frequency you can create a standing wave

## Harmonic Frequency
Standing wave patterns are only produced when the oscillator, and therefore the string, vibrate at the **Harmonic Frequency (or just harmonic)**. Only at these specific frequencies we call harmonics do we get the production of a standing wave pattern we can observe. The first of these harmonics are called the **fundamental frequency** 
### Harmonic Wave Patterns
Depending on which harmonic frequency the medium is vibrating at we get different patterns. At these harmonic frequency only an exact multiple of half wavelengths on the string, so there is a node at each end. The length of a standing wave can be given as $$L=\frac{n\lambda}{2}$$

For every successive harmonic the Node and Anti node count increases by 1, there a $n+1$ nodes and $n$ anti-nodes
