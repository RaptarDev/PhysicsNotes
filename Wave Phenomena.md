## Reflection
#### What is reflection?
**Reflection** is when a wave is thrown back at the interface of two media

$$\theta_i =\theta_r$$
$$Angle \space of\space reflection = Angle \space of \space Incidence$$

## Refraction
When a wave hits a interface between to media, two phenomena can occur, **reflection** and **transmission** *(Light goes into the medium)*. If transmission occurs and the refractive indices of the materials are different refraction will occur. 

**Refraction** is when a wave changes direction after entering a medium with a **different refractive index** to the one it was in prior. This is because the light travels at different speeds through these materials.

#### What is the Refractive index?
The **Refractive Index** is a measure of how fast light travels through a material.
It is measured to the speed of light in a vacuum ($c$) 
Light always travels at c, it just takes a longer path through different media. Crashing into lots of particles that change its direction.
Can be thought of how difficult it is for light to travel through a material.

The Refractive index of Air has $n\approx1$

The Higher the refractive index, the slower the wave through the medium, the more the medium.
## Diffraction
**Diffraction** is when a plane wave *(wave moving in a straight line)* bends after passing through narrow opening. 
The wavelength of the wave must be either similar or larger in size to the opening to observe diffraction. If $\frac{\lambda}{w}\geq1$ diffraction will occur.![[Pasted image 20250624232108.png]]
## Superposition
**Superposition** states when two or more waves cross, the resultant waves's displacement is equal to the vector sum of the individual displacements.

### Interference and Coherence

For Interference to occur the two waves must be **Coherent**. The two waves are coherent when they have the **same frequency** and **wavelength**, traveling with a **fixed phase difference** between them

*Interference can happen with waves of different frequencies and wavelengths but it is a mess*


#### Constructive Interference
When two waves add together to give a resultant wave with greater displacements at all points.

#### Destructive Interference
When two waves add together to give a resultant wave with smaller displacements than the original wave
